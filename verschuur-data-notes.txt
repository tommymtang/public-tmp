1) WTF is OxMarTrans (is this shit even real)

2) In PLAIN ENGLISH:


Modal_split: at each port, volume and mode of traffic/trade (global modal split model)

Port_statistics: details of trade (Weight/value) through a port

Network: the literal network for the maritime transport network model. The literal MTN

Maritime_transport: Output of the freight flow allocation on the maritime network

Port_IO_tables: Output of the connection between the link between the transport model and the multi-regional input-output tables (MRIO). 
-------
The port import coefficient estimates the maritime imports needed to meet the final demand in an economy, either via exports or domestic consumption.
-------
The port output coefficient estimates the industry output and final consumption which is linked to the trade-flows going through a port. 


Port_to_port_network: freight flows between ports (output of MTN model)

Unclear the differences between port-to-port network, martitime transport,and port-io-tables

BY SECTION
---------------------
Modal_split
-----
Output of the global modal split model, estimating the fraction of trade in 2015 using a specific mode
v: value of goods (in 1,000 USD)
q: weight of goods (in tonnes)
v_air_predict: value of goods via air transport
q_air_predict: weight of goods via air transport
v_sea_predict: value of goods via maritime transport
q_sea_predict: weight of goods via maritime transport
v_land_predict: value of goods via land transport
q_land_predict: weight of goods via land transport

-----
Network
The maritime nodes and edges used to construct the maritime transport network
-----
-----
-----
Port_IO_tables
Output of the connection between the link between the transport model and the multi-regional input-output tables (MRIO). 
-------
The port import coefficient estimates the maritime imports needed to meet the final demand in an economy, either via exports or domestic consumption.
-------
The port output coefficient estimates the industry output and final consumption which is linked to the trade-flows going through a port. 
-----
-----
-----
Port_statistics
Aggregate port statistics as output of the maritime transport model
-------
The port_locations_value file contains the value of the throughput flowing through port
-------
The port_locations_weight file contains the weight of the throughput flowing through port
----
The port_foreign_domestic_trade file contains the value for throughput, split out in a domestic (flows coming from or going to domestic economy) or foreign (flows coming from or going to foreign economy) part. 
-----
-----
-----
Port_to_port_network
The freight statistics and port-to-port trade network, which is the output of the maritime transport model
-----
The file freight_cost_aggregate contains freight flows between two countries per sector, including the share of that being allocated on the maritime transport and hinterland transport networks. 
-----
The port_trade_network file contains the allocated freight flows through ports, including the origin and destination countries of the trade flow. 
-----
-----
-----
Maritime_transport
Output of the freight flow allocation on the maritime network. 

The 'maritime_network_flows.csv' includes all freight flows allocated on the maritime edges in weight and value.

The files 'edges_panama_maritime.csv' and 'nodes_panama_port.csv' contains the freight flows going through the Panama canal and their origin and destination ports. Flows are both in value and in weight (tonnes). 

The files 'edges_suez_maritime.csv' and 'nodes_suez_port.csv' contains the freight flows going through the Suez canal and their origin and destination ports. Flows are both in value and in weight (tonnes).
